The assets directory is used for storing stylesheets, javascript sources and images which are used globally within the project. While the media directory is used to store images, audio or other media files which are referenced by some pages or blog posts. These directories and their contents will be copied into the destination directory when the project is built.<p>When a new Serum project is being initialized, these two directories are also automatically created. However you may remove those directories if you plan to have no design assets or media files. In that case, Serum will warn you that either assets or media directory is missing.<p>Serum also creates <code class=inline>css</code>, <code class=inline>js</code> and <code class=inline>images</code> directories under the <code class=inline>assets</code> directory. This is just for your convenience, therefore you are free to change the inner directory structure to fit your needs.<p>You can reference any assets from any template by using <code class=inline>asset/1</code> template helper function.<pre><code class=html>&lt;!-- Example: --&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;&lt;%= asset &quot;css/style.css&quot; %&gt;&quot;&gt;</code></pre><p>By doing this, you can avoid hard-coding the full URL in every reference to your assets.<blockquote class=note><header>NOTE</header><p>You can also refer to any media files in templates by using <code>base/1</code> function. However, it's not recommended to do this because media files are intended to be used in a specific page or blog post.</blockquote></div></article></main><hr><footer><p>Copyright &copy; 2017 Dalgona. <a href=https://dalgona.github.io/ >[Website]</a> <a href=https://github.com/Dalgona>[GitHub]</a><p>This website was generated by <a href=https://github.com/Dalgona/Serum>Serum</a>.</footer></div><script src=/Serum/assets/js/prism.js></script>
